> This script/repo/tool does follow the automation guidelines on the /r/adventofcode community wiki (and link to this
> article that you're currently reading right
> now [https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation] somewhere).
> Specifically:
>
> - Outbound calls are throttled to every x minutes in throttleFunction()
> - Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally (cacheFunction())
> - If you suspect your input is corrupted, you can manually request a fresh copy using manualDownloadFunction()
> - The User-Agent header in userAgentHeaderFunction() is set to me since I maintain this tool :)

> This scraper only downloads the inputs if the inputs do not yet already exist.
> So the inputs will be downloaded once for every machine this solution is run on.
